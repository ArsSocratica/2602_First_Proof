# Problem 8 — Symplectic Geometry: Polyhedral Lagrangian Smoothing

## Problem Statement

A polyhedral Lagrangian surface $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is a finite polyhedral complex all of whose faces are Lagrangians, and which is a topological submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^4$. A Lagrangian smoothing of $K$ is a Hamiltonian isotopy $K_t$ of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds, parameterised by $(0,1]$, extending to a topological isotopy, parametrised by $[0,1]$, with endpoint $K_0 = K$.

Let $K$ be a polyhedral Lagrangian surface with the property that exactly $4$ faces meet at every vertex. Does $K$ necessarily have a Lagrangian smoothing?
