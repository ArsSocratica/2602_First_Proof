\subsection{Problem 5: Equivariant $\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration}
\label{sec:p05}

\paragraph{Official solution (Blumberg--Hill--Lawson).}
The official proof defines the $\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration via
localizing subcategories generated by
$G_+ \wedge_H N_T S^1$ for admissible~$T$, and introduces the
characteristic function
$\chi_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = \min\{K : K \to H\}$.
The main result (Theorem~2.7) states:
$E \in \tau^{\mathcal{O}}_{\ge n}$ if and only if
$[H : \chi_{\mathcal{O}}(H)] \cdot \mathrm{gconn}(E)(H) \ge n$
for all~$H$.
The forward direction uses Lemma~2.3 (restriction to generators);
the reverse uses isotropy separation, Lemma~2.5, Lemma~2.6
(geometric Mackey functors), and induction on the subgroup lattice.

\paragraph{Our solution.}
Our Theorem~3.1 states: $X$ is $\mathcal{O}$-slice $\ge n$ if and
only if $\Phi^H X$ is $(\lfloor n/|H| \rfloor - 1)$-connected for
all $H \in \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{O}}$.
The forward direction uses strong induction on~$|H|$ and the
Wirthm\"uller isomorphism; the reverse uses isotropy separation
and induction on the subgroup lattice.

We additionally produced a Lean~4 formalization (0~\texttt{sorry})
verifying the combinatorial and arithmetic skeleton: transfer system
axioms, dimension bookkeeping, and the strong induction structure.

\paragraph{Assessment.}
This is the \emph{closest match} to the official solution among all
ten problems.  Both proofs use isotropy separation and induction on
the subgroup lattice.  The connectivity bound formulas differ
slightly in notation ($[H:\chi_{\mathcal{O}}(H)]$ vs.\ $|H|$ with
restriction to $\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{O}}$) but are equivalent when
$\chi_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = e$.

Both use the same key lemmas: Wirthm\"uller isomorphism, compactness
of slice cells, geometric fixed point computation.
The official commentary notes that LLMs got the statement essentially
correct but proofs were ``sketched or slightly garbled''---our proof
is fully detailed.

Our Lean~4 formalization adds a layer of verification not present
in the official release.

\paragraph{Author feedback.}
Blumberg~\cite[\S4.5]{FirstProofSolutions2026}: ``The LLMs got the
statement essentially correct but proofs were `sketched or slightly
garbled'.''
Our proof is fully detailed with all steps, and our Lean~4
formalization (0~\texttt{sorry}) adds a layer of verification not
present in any other submission.

\medskip\noindent
\textbf{Verdict:} \yes\ answer, \yes\ proof (nearly identical
structure, plus Lean~4).
\textbf{Correct with complete proof.}
