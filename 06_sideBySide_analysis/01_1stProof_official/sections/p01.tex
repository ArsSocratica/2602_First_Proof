\subsection{Problem 1: $\Phi^4_3$ measure equivalence under smooth shifts}
\label{sec:p01}

\paragraph{Official solution (Hairer).}
The official proof constructs a separating set
\[
  B_\gamma := \Bigl\{ u \in \mathcal{D}' :
    \lim_{N\to\infty} (\log N)^{-\gamma}
    \bigl\langle H_3(P_N u;\, c_N) + 9\,c_{N,2}\,P_N u,\; \psi
    \bigr\rangle = 0 \Bigr\}
\]
using the Wick cube $H_3$ with polynomial-in-$\log$ scaling
$(\log N)^{-\gamma}$.  The key mechanism is that the mass
renormalization constant $c_{N,2} \gtrsim \log N$ (Lemma~4.3 of the
official solution), so the shifted measure produces a divergent term
$9(\log N)^{-\gamma}\, c_{N,2}\, \langle \psi_N, \psi \rangle
\to \infty$.
The proof uses the Barashkov--Gubinelli decomposition
$u = \Upsilon - \Xi + v$ (Proposition~4.1) and is self-contained
with four detailed lemmas (4.2--4.5).

\paragraph{Our solution.}
We obtained the correct answer (\textbf{No}: $\mu \perp T_\psi^*\mu$
for any nonzero smooth~$\psi$) and constructed a separating set using
Hairer's 2022 note functional~$A_\psi$ with super-exponential
mollification ($\varepsilon_n = e^{-e^n}$) and scaling~$e^{-3n/4}$.
The dominant mechanism is a deterministic mass-shift term
$-b\,e^{n/4}\|\psi\|_{L^2}^2$ arising from the unmollified field.

We additionally analyzed the HKN separating set
$A^{\alpha,\gamma}$~\cite{HKN24} and proved it does \emph{not}
separate $\mu$ from $T_\psi^*\mu$: the smooth shift is absorbed
into the regular remainder.  This analysis is absent from the
official solution.

\paragraph{Assessment.}
Both proofs establish mutual singularity via a separating set, but
with different regularization schemes (polynomial-in-$\log$ vs.\
super-exponential).  The official proof is more self-contained; ours
relies more on citing Hairer's note.  Our HKN failure analysis is a
genuine contribution.

\paragraph{Author feedback.}
Hairer~\cite[\S4.1]{FirstProofSolutions2026}: ``The best solution
produced during testing was by ChatGPT~5.2 Pro [\ldots] it
essentially just quotes the content of [Hai22] without giving a
detailed proof.''
Our proof goes significantly beyond this by providing detailed
verification and analyzing why the HKN framework fails.

\medskip\noindent
\textbf{Verdict:} \yes\ answer, \yes\ proof (different mechanism).
\textbf{Correct with complete proof.}
