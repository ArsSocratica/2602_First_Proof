# Problem 8 — Polyhedral Lagrangian Smoothing

## Theorem

Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ be a polyhedral Lagrangian surface — that is, a finite 2-dimensional polyhedral complex embedded in $\mathbb{R}^4$ as a topological 2-manifold (possibly with boundary), whose faces are convex polygons each contained in a Lagrangian plane — with the property that exactly 4 faces meet at every vertex. Then $K$ has a Lagrangian smoothing: there exists a family $\{K_t\}_{t \in (0,1]}$ of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds forming a Hamiltonian isotopy, extending to a topological isotopy on $[0,1]$ with $K_0 = K$.

**Answer: YES.**

## Notation and Setup

Let $(\mathbb{R}^4, \omega)$ denote $\mathbb{R}^4$ with the standard symplectic form $\omega = \sum_{j=1}^2 dq_j \wedge dp_j$ (equivalently, $\omega = dx_1 \wedge dy_1 + dx_2 \wedge dy_2$ in coordinates $(x_j, y_j) = (q_j, p_j)$). We use the Liouville form $\lambda = -\sum_{j=1}^2 p_j\, dq_j$, so that $d\lambda = -\sum dp_j \wedge dq_j = \sum dq_j \wedge dp_j = \omega$. (Equivalently, $\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^2 (q_j\, dp_j - p_j\, dq_j)$ differs from $-\sum p_j dq_j$ by an exact form.)

Let $K$ be a polyhedral Lagrangian surface with vertex set $V = \{v_1, \ldots, v_N\}$, edge set $E$, and face set $F$. Each face $f \in F$ is a convex polygon contained in a Lagrangian plane $\Pi_f \subset \mathbb{R}^4$. The valence-4 hypothesis means that for each $v \in V$, exactly 4 faces are incident to $v$.

Let $\delta = \frac{1}{3}\min\{|v_i - v_j| : v_i \neq v_j \in V\}$ be one-third the minimum inter-vertex distance.

## Step 1: Local Structure at a Valence-4 Vertex

**Lemma 1** (Vertex normal form). *Let $v \in V$ be a vertex of $K$ with incident faces $F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4$ in cyclic order. Then:*

*(a) There exist 4 edge directions $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4 \in T_v\mathbb{R}^4$, spanning $\mathbb{R}^4$, where $e_k$ is the direction of the edge between $F_k$ and $F_{k+1}$ (mod 4). The face planes are $\Pi_k = \mathrm{span}(e_{k-1}, e_k)$, and the Lagrangian condition gives $\omega(e_k, e_{k+1}) = 0$ for all $k$ (mod 4).*

*(b) The 4 planes may all be distinct.*

*(c) (Canonical normal form.) After translation and a linear symplectomorphism, we may place $v$ at the origin and assume, in Darboux coordinates $(q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2)$ with $\omega = dq_1 \wedge dp_1 + dq_2 \wedge dp_2$:*
$$e_1 = \partial_{q_1},\quad e_2 = \partial_{q_2},\quad e_3 = a_1\,\partial_{q_1} + a_2\,\partial_{q_2} + \partial_{p_1},\quad e_4 = a_2\,\partial_{q_1} + b_2\,\partial_{q_2} + \partial_{p_2}$$
*where $a_1, a_2, b_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ are the moduli of the vertex configuration. In particular, $\Pi_2 = \{p = 0\}$.*

*Proof.*

**(a)** Since $K$ is a topological 2-manifold, $\text{Lk}(v, K) \cong S^1$ with 4 arcs. Consecutive faces $F_k, F_{k+1}$ share an edge in direction $e_k \in \Pi_k \cap \Pi_{k+1}$. Since $\Pi_k$ is 2-dimensional and contains $e_{k-1}$ and $e_k$, we get $\Pi_k = \text{span}(e_{k-1}, e_k)$. The Lagrangian condition $\omega|_{\Pi_k} = 0$ gives $\omega(e_{k-1}, e_k) = 0$.

**Spanning:** The 4 vectors $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$ span $\mathbb{R}^4$. If not, they lie in a subspace $W$ of dimension $\leq 3$. Each $\Pi_k = \text{span}(e_{k-1}, e_k) \subset W$. But a Lagrangian plane has dimension 2, and $\omega|_{\Pi_k} = 0$, so $\Pi_k$ is an isotropic subspace. In a 3-dimensional subspace $W \subset \mathbb{R}^4$, the restriction $\omega|_W$ has rank 2 (since $\omega$ is nondegenerate on $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\dim W = 3$), so $W$ contains a unique isotropic line $\ell = \ker(\omega|_W)$ and every 2-dimensional isotropic subspace of $W$ must contain $\ell$. This would force $\ell \subset \Pi_k$ for all $k$, hence $\ell \subset \Pi_k \cap \Pi_{k+1} = \mathbb{R} e_k$ for all $k$, giving $e_1 \parallel e_2 \parallel e_3 \parallel e_4$ — contradicting the fact that consecutive faces are distinct (the link has 4 distinct arcs).

**(b)** Example: $e_1 = \partial_{q_1}$, $e_2 = \partial_{q_2}$, $e_3 = \partial_{p_1}$, $e_4 = \partial_{p_2}$ (i.e., $a_1 = a_2 = b_2 = 0$ in the normal form). One checks $\omega(e_k, e_{k+1}) = 0$ for all $k$ (mod 4). The planes $\Pi_1 = \text{span}(\partial_{p_2}, \partial_{q_1})$, $\Pi_2 = \text{span}(\partial_{q_1}, \partial_{q_2})$, $\Pi_3 = \text{span}(\partial_{q_2}, \partial_{p_1})$, $\Pi_4 = \text{span}(\partial_{p_1}, \partial_{p_2})$ are all distinct Lagrangian planes.

**(c)** We construct the normal form in three steps.

**Step (c.1):** Since $\Pi_2 = \text{span}(e_1, e_2)$ is a Lagrangian plane, there exists a linear symplectomorphism mapping $\Pi_2$ to $\{p = 0\}$. (The symplectic group $\text{Sp}(2n)$ acts transitively on the Lagrangian Grassmannian; see McDuff-Salamon [MS17], Lemma 2.1.4.)

**Step (c.2):** After Step (c.1), $e_1, e_2 \in \{p = 0\}$. Apply $\Phi_2 \in \text{GL}(2) \hookrightarrow \text{Sp}(4)$ (acting as $q \mapsto Aq$, $p \mapsto (A^{-T})p$) to place $e_1 = \partial_{q_1}$, $e_2 = \partial_{q_2}$.

**Step (c.3):** Write $e_3 = a_1\partial_{q_1} + a_2\partial_{q_2} + \alpha_1\partial_{p_1} + \alpha_2\partial_{p_2}$ and $e_4 = b_1\partial_{q_1} + b_2\partial_{q_2} + \beta_1\partial_{p_1} + \beta_2\partial_{p_2}$. We impose the four constraints:

- $\omega(e_2, e_3) = 0$: Since $\omega(\partial_{q_2}, \partial_{p_j}) = \delta_{2j}$, this gives $\alpha_2 = 0$.
- $\omega(e_4, e_1) = 0$: Since $\omega(\partial_{q_1}, \partial_{p_j}) = \delta_{1j}$, this gives $\beta_1 = 0$.
- $\omega(e_3, e_4) = 0$: Using $\omega(u,v) = \sum_j(u^{q_j}v^{p_j} - u^{p_j}v^{q_j})$, we get $a_1 \cdot 0 + a_2\beta_2 - \alpha_1 b_1 - 0 \cdot b_2 = a_2\beta_2 - \alpha_1 b_1 = 0$.
- Spanning: $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$ span $\mathbb{R}^4$ iff $\alpha_1 \neq 0$ and $\beta_2 \neq 0$.

(The fourth constraint $\omega(e_1, e_2) = 0$ is automatic since $e_1, e_2 \in \{p=0\}$.)

So $e_3 = (a_1, a_2, \alpha_1, 0)$ and $e_4 = (b_1, b_2, 0, \beta_2)$ with $a_2\beta_2 = \alpha_1 b_1$, $\alpha_1 \neq 0$, $\beta_2 \neq 0$.

Rescale $e_3 \mapsto e_3/\alpha_1$ and $e_4 \mapsto e_4/\beta_2$ (this does not change the planes $\Pi_k$). Now $\alpha_1 = \beta_2 = 1$, and the constraint becomes $b_1 = a_2$. Relabel $a_1/\alpha_1 \to a_1$, $a_2/\alpha_1 \to a_2$, $b_2/\beta_2 \to b_2$. The result is:
$$e_3 = a_1\,\partial_{q_1} + a_2\,\partial_{q_2} + \partial_{p_1}, \quad e_4 = a_2\,\partial_{q_1} + b_2\,\partial_{q_2} + \partial_{p_2}. \qquad \qed$$

---

## Step 2: Local Smoothing via Generating Functions

**Lemma 2** (Generating function description at a vertex). *In the canonical normal form of Lemma 1(c), the 4 sectors of $K$ near the vertex are the graph of $dg_v$ for a PL function $g_v: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, provided the following transversality condition holds:*
$$a_1 \neq 0,\quad b_2 \neq 0,\quad \Delta := a_1 b_2 - a_2^2 \neq 0. \tag{$\star$}$$

*Proof.* In the normal form, the 4 edge directions are $e_1 = \partial_{q_1}$, $e_2 = \partial_{q_2}$, $e_3 = a_1\partial_{q_1} + a_2\partial_{q_2} + \partial_{p_1}$, $e_4 = a_2\partial_{q_1} + b_2\partial_{q_2} + \partial_{p_2}$. The projection $\pi: (q,p) \mapsto q$ restricted to each $\Pi_k$ is a linear map $\Pi_k \to \mathbb{R}^2$. This is an isomorphism iff $\Pi_k \cap \{q = 0\} = \{0\}$, i.e., $\Pi_k$ is transverse to the fibers. We check:

- $\Pi_2 = \{p = 0\}$: $\pi|_{\Pi_2}$ is the identity. $\checkmark$
- $\Pi_1 = \text{span}(e_1, e_4)$: $\pi(e_1) = (1,0)$, $\pi(e_4) = (a_2, b_2)$. Isomorphism iff $b_2 \neq 0$. $\checkmark$
- $\Pi_3 = \text{span}(e_2, e_3)$: $\pi(e_2) = (0,1)$, $\pi(e_3) = (a_1, a_2)$. Isomorphism iff $a_1 \neq 0$. $\checkmark$
- $\Pi_4 = \text{span}(e_3, e_4)$: $\pi(e_3) = (a_1, a_2)$, $\pi(e_4) = (a_2, b_2)$. Isomorphism iff $\Delta = a_1 b_2 - a_2^2 \neq 0$. $\checkmark$

When all four projections are isomorphisms, each $\Pi_k$ is the graph of a linear map $p = A_k q$: that is, $\Pi_k = \{(q, A_k q) : q \in \mathbb{R}^2\}$ for a unique symmetric matrix $A_k$ (symmetric because $\Pi_k$ is Lagrangian). The generating function is $h_k(q) = \frac{1}{2}q^T A_k q$, so $\nabla h_k = A_k q$ and $\Pi_k = \text{graph}(dh_k)$. We have $A_2 = 0$ (since $\Pi_2 = \{p = 0\}$). The remaining $A_k$ are computed explicitly (see Appendix A).

Each sector $F_k$ (a cone in $\Pi_k$ bounded by two edge rays) projects to a sector $S_k$ in $q$-space, and on $S_k$ the surface $K$ is the graph of $dh_k$. The 4 sectors $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ tile a neighborhood of the origin in $\mathbb{R}^2$: the link $\text{Lk}(v, K) \cong S^1$ maps continuously under $\pi$ to a closed curve in $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, and since $\pi|_{\Pi_k}$ is an isomorphism for each $k$ (by $(\star)$), the projected link is a piecewise-linear simple closed curve through the 4 rays $\mathbb{R}_{>0}\pi(e_k)$ in cyclic order.

Define $g_v: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $g_v(q) = h_k(q)$ for $q \in S_k$. This is a piecewise-quadratic function with $K \cap U = \text{graph}(dg_v)$ in a neighborhood $U$ of $v$.

**Regularity of $g_v$:** On the boundary ray $\pi(e_k)$ between sectors $S_k$ and $S_{k+1}$, since $e_k \in \Pi_k \cap \Pi_{k+1}$, the $p$-component of $e_k$ equals both $A_k \pi(e_k)$ and $A_{k+1}\pi(e_k)$. Therefore $\nabla h_k = \nabla h_{k+1}$ along the ray $\pi(e_k)$, so $g_v$ is $C^1$ (not merely $C^0$). The discontinuity is in the second derivatives (the Hessians $A_k$ jump across crease lines). In particular, $g_v$ is Lipschitz with Lipschitz gradient. $\qed$

**Remark on condition $(\star)$.** If $(\star)$ fails, we choose a **different** Lagrangian plane $\Pi_0$ as the base for the cotangent identification $\mathbb{R}^4 \cong T^*\Pi_0$, instead of $\Pi_2 = \{p = 0\}$. The set of Lagrangian planes transverse to a given plane is open and dense in $\Lambda(2)$ (the Lagrangian Grassmannian), and a finite intersection of open dense sets is open dense. Therefore there exists $\Pi_0$ transverse to all four $\Pi_k$ simultaneously. Identifying $\mathbb{R}^4 \cong T^*\Pi_0$ via a linear symplectomorphism mapping $\Pi_0$ to the zero section, the argument of Lemma 2 applies verbatim.

**Proposition 1** (Local Lagrangian smoothing). *For each vertex $v \in V$ and each $\epsilon > 0$ sufficiently small, there exists a smooth Lagrangian surface $K_\epsilon^{(v)}$ in a neighborhood of $v$ such that:*
1. *$K_\epsilon^{(v)}$ agrees with $K$ outside $B(v, C\epsilon)$ for a constant $C$ depending on the vertex geometry.*
2. *$K_\epsilon^{(v)}$ is a smooth embedded Lagrangian surface.*
3. *$K_\epsilon^{(v)} \to K \cap B(v, R)$ in the Hausdorff topology as $\epsilon \to 0$.*
4. *$K_\epsilon^{(v)}$ is the graph of $dg_v^\epsilon$ for a smooth function $g_v^\epsilon: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$.*

*Proof.* By Lemma 2, after applying the canonical normal form and (if necessary) a further symplectomorphism to ensure $(\star)$, the surface $K$ near $v$ is the graph of $dg_v$ for a PL function $g_v$.

**Smoothing by mollification.** Let $\chi: \mathbb{R}^2 \to [0,\infty)$ be a smooth bump function with $\text{supp}(\chi) \subset B(0,1)$, $\int \chi = 1$, and $\chi_\epsilon(q) = \epsilon^{-2}\chi(q/\epsilon)$. Define:
$$g_v^\epsilon = g_v * \chi_\epsilon.$$

Since $g_v$ is PL (piecewise quadratic), $g_v^\epsilon$ is smooth for all $\epsilon > 0$. The graph $\text{graph}(dg_v^\epsilon) = \{(q, \nabla g_v^\epsilon(q))\}$ is automatically a smooth Lagrangian submanifold of $T^*\mathbb{R}^2 \cong \mathbb{R}^4$ (since $\text{graph}(dh)^*\omega = \sum_{j,k} \partial^2_{q_j q_k}h\, dq_j \wedge dq_k = 0$ by symmetry of the Hessian).

**Properties:** (1) Outside $B(0, C\epsilon)$: if $q$ is at distance $> \epsilon$ from all crease lines of $g_v$, then $g_v$ is quadratic near $q$, so $g_v * \chi_\epsilon = g_v$ near $q$. The crease lines emanate from the origin, so $g_v^\epsilon = g_v$ for $|q| > \epsilon/c$, giving $C = 1/c$. (2) Smoothness: $g_v^\epsilon$ is $C^\infty$. (3) Hausdorff convergence: since $g_v$ is $C^1$ with Lipschitz gradient, $\|\nabla g_v^\epsilon - \nabla g_v\|_{C^0} \leq C_1 \epsilon$. (4) By construction. $\qed$

**Remark.** The key point is that the graph of $dh$ is Lagrangian for **any** smooth function $h$, so the Lagrangian condition is automatic after mollification. This is the fundamental advantage of the generating function approach.

## Step 3: Edge Smoothing

**Lemma 3** (Edge smoothing). *Along each edge $e$ of $K$ (away from vertex neighborhoods), the two adjacent faces share the edge direction and lie in Lagrangian planes $\Pi_i, \Pi_j$ with $\dim(\Pi_i \cap \Pi_j) \geq 1$. In a neighborhood of a point on $e$, $K$ is the graph of $dg_e$ for a PL convex function $g_e$ with a single crease. Mollification $g_e \mapsto g_e * \chi_\epsilon$ produces a smooth Lagrangian.*

*Proof.* Near a point on $e$ (away from vertices), we need a base plane $\Pi_0$ transverse to both $\Pi_i$ and $\Pi_j$. Since $\Pi_i$ and $\Pi_j$ are distinct Lagrangian planes sharing a line, $\dim(\Pi_i + \Pi_j) = 3$, so $\Pi_i$ itself cannot serve as the base. We choose $\Pi_0$ transverse to both (by the same open-density argument as in the Remark on $(\star)$). Identifying $\mathbb{R}^4 \cong T^*\Pi_0$, both $F_i$ and $F_j$ are graphs of linear 1-forms $dl_i$ and $dl_j$ over $\Pi_0$. The union $F_i \cup F_j$ near the edge is the graph of $dg_e$ where $g_e(q) = \min(l_i(q), l_j(q))$. Since $l_i$ and $l_j$ agree on the projected edge line, $g_e$ is PL with a single crease. Mollification $g_e * \chi_\epsilon$ produces a smooth function whose graph is Lagrangian. $\qed$

---

## Step 4: Global Assembly

**Proposition 2** (Global smoothing). *For $\epsilon > 0$ sufficiently small, the local smoothings combine to give a globally well-defined smooth Lagrangian surface $K_\epsilon \subset \mathbb{R}^4$.*

*Proof.* Let $C_v$ be the constant from Proposition 1 for vertex $v$, and set $C_{\max} = \max_v C_v$. Choose $\epsilon < \delta / C_{\max}$. Then the modification regions $B(v_i, C_{v_i}\epsilon)$ are pairwise disjoint.

**Edge-vertex compatibility.** Both constructions are defined via generating functions, using potentially different cotangent bundle identifications of $\mathbb{R}^4$. (The cotangent identification is a computational device; compatibility is checked as subsets of $\mathbb{R}^4$.) In the overlap region, both constructions agree with $K$ itself: the vertex smoothing equals $K$ outside $B(v, C_v\epsilon)$, and the edge smoothing equals $K$ away from the crease. The edge smoothing is only needed **outside** all vertex balls, where it operates on a single crease line — and there is no overlap with the vertex smoothing.

**Assembly:** Define $K_\epsilon$ by:
- In $B(v, C_v\epsilon)$ for each vertex $v$: use $K_\epsilon^{(v)} = \text{graph}(dg_v^\epsilon)$ from Proposition 1.
- Along each edge $e$, in the region $\{q : \text{dist}(q, e) < \epsilon\} \setminus \bigcup_v B(v, C_v\epsilon)$: use $\text{graph}(dg_e^\epsilon)$ from Lemma 3.
- On face interiors (distance $> \epsilon$ from all edges): keep $K$ unchanged.

**Smoothness at boundaries.** At the boundary of the edge-smoothing zone, $g_e$ is already quadratic, so $g_e * \chi_\epsilon = g_e$ there — the transition is $C^\infty$. Similarly, at the boundary of each vertex ball, $g_v^\epsilon = g_v$, so the vertex smoothing and the edge/face definitions agree exactly.

These three regions cover $K$, overlap only where all active constructions agree, and each piece is smooth. Therefore $K_\epsilon$ is globally well-defined and smooth. $\qed$

---

## Step 5: Hamiltonian Isotopy

**Theorem 1** (Main result). *The family $\{K_t\}_{t \in (0,1]}$ defined by $K_t = K_\epsilon$ with $\epsilon = t$ is a Hamiltonian isotopy of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds, extending to a topological isotopy on $[0,1]$ with $K_0 = K$.*

*Proof.*

**(a) Each $K_t$ is a smooth Lagrangian submanifold.** Follows from Proposition 2.

**(b) The family is a Hamiltonian isotopy for $t \in (0,1]$.**

The family $K_t$ varies smoothly in $t > 0$. The velocity of the isotopy defines a vector field $V_t$ along $K_t$. Since each $K_t$ is Lagrangian, the 1-form $\alpha_t := \iota_{V_t}\omega|_{K_t}$ is closed (see McDuff-Salamon [MS17], Proposition 9.33).

To show $\alpha_t$ is exact (hence the isotopy is Hamiltonian), we show that the **cohomology class** $[\iota_t^*\lambda] \in H^1(K_t; \mathbb{R})$ is **independent of $t$**.

**Claim:** $\frac{d}{dt}[\iota_t^*\lambda] = 0$ in $H^1(K_t; \mathbb{R})$.

*Proof of claim.* Since $\omega = d\lambda$ and $\omega|_{K_t} = 0$, we have $d(\iota_t^*\lambda) = 0$, so $\iota_t^*\lambda$ is a closed 1-form on $K_t$. Its cohomology class is determined by its periods $\int_\gamma \iota_t^*\lambda$ over a basis of $H_1(K_t; \mathbb{Z})$.

The modification $K \leadsto K_t$ is supported in the union of small balls $B(v, C_v t)$ around vertices and thin tubes around edges. For $t$ small, these regions are contractible. Therefore, any closed curve $\gamma \subset K_t$ can be deformed to avoid the modification regions. On the unmodified part, $K_t = K$, so $\iota_t^*\lambda = \iota_0^*\lambda$. Thus:
$$\int_\gamma \iota_t^*\lambda = \int_\gamma \iota_0^*\lambda$$
for all $[\gamma] \in H_1(K_t; \mathbb{Z})$, so $[\iota_t^*\lambda] = [\iota_0^*\lambda]$ is constant. $\qed$

It follows that $\alpha_t$ is exact. Since $[\iota_t^*\lambda]$ is constant, write $\iota_t^*\lambda = dS_t + \eta$ where $\eta$ is a fixed closed 1-form representing $[\iota_0^*\lambda]$ and $S_t$ is a smooth function on $K_t$. Differentiating and using $\frac{d}{dt}\iota_t^*\lambda = \alpha_t + d(\lambda(V_t) \circ \iota_t)$ (Cartan's magic formula), we obtain $\alpha_t = d(\dot{S}_t - \lambda(V_t) \circ \iota_t)$, which is exact. The Hamiltonian is $H_t = \dot{S}_t - \lambda(V_t) \circ \iota_t$. (See [MS17], Proposition 9.33.)

**Remark (compact case).** If $K$ is a closed surface, $K_t$ is NOT globally exact (by Gromov's theorem [Gr85], section 2.3.B; or [ALP94], Theorem 3.1). However, the argument above does **not** require global exactness — only constancy of $[\iota_t^*\lambda]$.

**(c) Topological isotopy extending to $t = 0$.**

We construct an explicit continuous map $\Phi: K \times [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^4$ with $\Phi(\cdot, 0) = \iota_0$ and $\Phi(\cdot, t)$ a homeomorphism onto $K_t$ for $t > 0$.

On face interiors, $\Phi(x, t) = x$. Near a vertex $v$: define $\Phi(q, \nabla g_v(q), t) = (q, \nabla g_v^t(q))$. This is continuous in $(q, t)$ since $g_v$ is $C^1$ with Lipschitz gradient and $\|\nabla g_v^t - \nabla g_v\|_{C^0(B_R)} \leq C_R \cdot t$. Near edges: similarly, $\Phi(q, dg_e(q), t) = (q, dg_e^t(q))$. These definitions are compatible on overlaps, so $\Phi$ is globally well-defined and continuous. $\qed$

## Appendix A: Explicit Matrix Computations

The matrices $A_k$ in Lemma 2 are computed by solving $p = A_k q$ on each plane:

On $\Pi_1 = \text{span}(e_1, e_4)$: a general point is $\alpha e_1 + \beta e_4 = (\alpha + \beta a_2, \beta b_2, 0, \beta)$, so $q = (\alpha + \beta a_2, \beta b_2)$ and $p = (0, \beta)$. From $q_2 = \beta b_2$ we get $\beta = q_2/b_2$, so $p_2 = q_2/b_2$ and $p_1 = 0$. Thus:
$$A_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/b_2 \end{pmatrix}.$$

On $\Pi_3 = \text{span}(e_2, e_3)$: a general point is $\alpha e_2 + \beta e_3 = (\beta a_1, \alpha + \beta a_2, \beta, 0)$, so $q = (\beta a_1, \alpha + \beta a_2)$ and $p = (\beta, 0)$. From $q_1 = \beta a_1$ we get $\beta = q_1/a_1$, so $p_1 = q_1/a_1$ and $p_2 = 0$. Thus:
$$A_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1/a_1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$

On $\Pi_4 = \text{span}(e_3, e_4)$: a general point is $\alpha e_3 + \beta e_4 = (\alpha a_1 + \beta a_2, \alpha a_2 + \beta b_2, \alpha, \beta)$, so $q = (\alpha a_1 + \beta a_2, \alpha a_2 + \beta b_2)$ and $p = (\alpha, \beta)$. Inverting: $\begin{pmatrix}\alpha \\ \beta\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\Delta}\begin{pmatrix}b_2 & -a_2 \\ -a_2 & a_1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}q_1 \\ q_2\end{pmatrix}$. Thus:
$$A_4 = \frac{1}{\Delta}\begin{pmatrix} b_2 & -a_2 \\ -a_2 & a_1 \end{pmatrix}.$$

## Appendix B: Discussion of Potential Obstructions

The problem asks whether $K$ **necessarily** has a Lagrangian smoothing. We have constructed one, but we should verify that no hidden obstruction invalidates the construction.

**Embeddedness.** The smoothed surface $K_t$ is embedded (not just immersed) because it is globally the graph of a 1-form $dg_t$ over a 2-dimensional base (in each local chart). Graphs are automatically embedded. The global embeddedness follows from the fact that $K$ is embedded and the modification is $C^0$-small: for $t$ sufficiently small, $K_t$ is $C^0$-close to $K$ and hence embedded (by a standard transversality argument; see Hirsch [Hi76], Chapter 3, Theorem 1.4).

**Topology.** The smoothing preserves the homeomorphism type of $K$: at each vertex, the PL disk (cone on 4 arcs) is replaced by a smooth disk (the graph of a smooth function over the same domain). The map $\Phi(\cdot, t)$ is a homeomorphism for all $t \geq 0$.

**Maslov class.** The Maslov class $\mu \in H^1(K_t; \mathbb{Z})$ is an invariant of the smooth Lagrangian $K_t$, not an obstruction to its existence. On face/edge regions (Lagrangian graphs over $\{p=0\}$), the tangent plane is always transverse to the fiber, so the Maslov class vanishes there. The total Maslov class is determined by the combinatorics of $K$ and is independent of $t > 0$.

**Gromov's theorem.** No closed Lagrangian in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is exact (Gromov [Gr85], section 2.3.B). If $K$ is closed, $K_t$ is not exact. But our proof does not claim exactness — it only uses the constancy of $[\iota_t^*\lambda]$, which holds regardless.

No obstruction prevents the construction. The answer is **YES**: every polyhedral Lagrangian surface with exactly 4 faces at every vertex has a Lagrangian smoothing. $\qed$
