# Problem 7 — Lattices in Lie Groups: Rational Acyclicity

## Result

**Partial result.** We prove the answer is **NO** for all uniform lattices in semi-simple groups $G$ with $\dim(G/K) \leq 4$:
- **Case 1:** All $G$ with fundamental rank $\delta(G) = 0$ (the equal-rank case), via an Euler characteristic obstruction.
- **Case 2:** $G = \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ ($\delta(G) = 1$, $\dim(G/K) = 3$), via dimension forcing and Perelman's geometrization theorem.
- **Case 2b:** $\dim(G/K) = 4$ with $\delta(G) \neq 0$: vacuous — no such $G$ exists (all $d = 4$ groups have $\delta = 0$).

The question remains **open** when $\delta(G) \neq 0$ and $\dim(G/K) \geq 5$. The smallest open case is $G = \mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{R})$, $d = 5$.

**On the quantifier.** The problem asks: "Suppose that $\Gamma$ is a uniform lattice in a real semi-simple group, and that $\Gamma$ contains some 2-torsion. Is it possible for $\Gamma$ to be the fundamental group of a compact manifold without boundary whose universal cover is acyclic over $\mathbb{Q}$?" The phrase "is it possible" is naturally existential: does there exist *any* such $(\Gamma, M)$ pair? Under this reading, our results eliminate all candidates with $d \leq 4$ but do not fully answer the question, since lattices in groups with $\delta(G) \neq 0$ and $d \geq 5$ remain. Under the alternative reading — for an *arbitrary* such $\Gamma$, can this happen? — our results give clean negative answers for all groups with $d \leq 4$.

## Notation and Setup

Let $G$ be a connected real semi-simple Lie group with finite center and no compact factors. Let $K \subset G$ be a maximal compact subgroup, so that $X = G/K$ is the associated Riemannian symmetric space of non-compact type. Let $d = \dim(X)$.

Let $\Gamma \subset G$ be a uniform (cocompact) lattice. By Selberg's lemma, $\Gamma$ contains a torsion-free normal subgroup $\Gamma' \trianglelefteq \Gamma$ of finite index $m = [\Gamma : \Gamma']$. The quotient $\Gamma' \backslash X$ is a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $d$.

Define the **fundamental rank** (or **deficiency**) of $G$:
$$\delta(G) = \operatorname{rank}_\mathbb{C}(\mathfrak{g}) - \operatorname{rank}_\mathbb{C}(\mathfrak{k})$$
where $\operatorname{rank}_\mathbb{C}(\mathfrak{g})$ denotes the absolute rank of $G$ (the dimension of a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}_\mathbb{C}$), and similarly for $K$. Equivalently, $\delta(G) = 0$ if and only if $K$ contains a maximal torus of $G$ (the "equal-rank" condition), which happens if and only if the compact dual $G_u/K$ has nonzero Euler characteristic.

We say $\widetilde{M}$ is **$\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic** if $\widetilde{H}_i(\widetilde{M}; \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for all $i \geq 0$, i.e., $H_0(\widetilde{M}; \mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q}$ and $H_i(\widetilde{M}; \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for $i > 0$.

## Proof of the Main Theorem (Case $\delta(G) = 0$)

**Theorem.** Let $G$ be a connected real semi-simple Lie group with finite center, no compact factors, and $\delta(G) = 0$. Let $\Gamma \subset G$ be a uniform lattice containing torsion. Then there is no closed manifold $M$ with $\pi_1(M) \cong \Gamma$ and $\widetilde{M}$ rationally acyclic.

*Proof.* Suppose for contradiction that such $M$ exists, with $n = \dim M$.

### Part A: $\chi(M) \neq 0$

**Lemma 1** (Spectral sequence collapse). Let $M$ be a closed manifold with $\pi_1(M) \cong \Gamma$ and $\widetilde{M}$ $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic. Then $H_i(M; \mathbb{Q}) \cong H_i(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q})$ for all $i \geq 0$.

*Proof.* The Cartan–Leray spectral sequence for the regular covering $\widetilde{M} \to M$ with deck group $\Gamma$ has
$$E_2^{p,q} = H_p(\Gamma;\, H_q(\widetilde{M}; \mathbb{Q})) \;\Longrightarrow\; H_{p+q}(M; \mathbb{Q}).$$
Since $\widetilde{M}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic, $H_q(\widetilde{M}; \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for $q > 0$ and $H_0(\widetilde{M}; \mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q}$ with trivial $\Gamma$-action. The spectral sequence is concentrated on the $q = 0$ line and collapses at $E_2$. $\square$

**Corollary 1.** $\chi(M) = \chi_\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) := \sum_{i=0}^{d} (-1)^i \dim_\mathbb{Q} H_i(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q})$, where $d = \operatorname{vcd}(\Gamma) = \dim(G/K)$.

**Corollary 2** (Dimension forcing). $\dim M = d = \dim(G/K)$.

*Proof.* Let $n = \dim M$. Since $\Gamma'$ is a torsion-free uniform lattice, $\Gamma' \backslash G/K$ is a closed orientable aspherical $d$-manifold, so $\Gamma'$ is a Poincaré duality group of dimension $d$ with $H^d(\Gamma'; \mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q}$. Since $G$ is connected, all deck transformations of $G/K \to \Gamma' \backslash G/K$ preserve orientation, so the conjugation action of $\Gamma/\Gamma'$ on $H^d(\Gamma'; \mathbb{Q})$ is trivial. The transfer map $\mathrm{tr}: H^d(\Gamma'; \mathbb{Q}) \to H^d(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q})$ then satisfies $\mathrm{tr}(x) = [\Gamma:\Gamma'] \cdot \mathrm{cores}(x) \neq 0$, giving $H^d(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q}) \neq 0$, hence $H_d(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q}) \neq 0$.

**Lower bound:** By Lemma 1, $H_d(M; \mathbb{Q}) \cong H_d(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q}) \neq 0$. If $n < d$, this is impossible since $M$ is $n$-dimensional.

**Upper bound:** Suppose $n > d$. By Lemma 1, $H_n(M; \mathbb{Q}) \cong H_n(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ (since $\operatorname{vcd}(\Gamma) = d < n$). If $M$ is orientable, $H_n(M; \mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q} \neq 0$, contradiction. If $M$ is non-orientable, pass to the orientable double cover $\hat{M} \to M$ with $\pi_1(\hat{M}) = \hat{\Gamma} := \ker(w_1) \leq \Gamma$ of index 2, where $w_1: \Gamma \to \{±1\}$ is the orientation character of $M$. Since $\widetilde{M}$ is also the universal cover of $\hat{M}$, it remains $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic. By Lemma 1 applied to $\hat{M}$: $H_n(\hat{M}; \mathbb{Q}) \cong H_n(\hat{\Gamma}; \mathbb{Q})$. Since $\hat{M}$ is closed orientable of dimension $n$, $H_n(\hat{M}; \mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q}$. But $\operatorname{vcd}(\hat{\Gamma}) = \operatorname{vcd}(\Gamma) = d < n$, giving $H_n(\hat{\Gamma}; \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ — contradiction.

Therefore $n = d$. $\square$

**Lemma 2** (Wall's rational Euler characteristic). $\chi_\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) = \chi(\Gamma' \backslash G/K) / m$.

*Proof.* Since $\Gamma'$ is torsion-free and cocompact, $\Gamma' \backslash G/K$ is a closed aspherical manifold with $\pi_1 = \Gamma'$, so $\chi_\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma') = \chi(\Gamma' \backslash G/K)$. The transfer map in group cohomology gives $\chi_\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) = \chi_\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma')/[\Gamma:\Gamma']$. This is Wall's rational Euler characteristic, independent of the choice of $\Gamma'$ (Brown, *Cohomology of Groups*, Ch. IX, §7). $\square$

**Lemma 3** (Gauss–Bonnet and fundamental rank). $\chi(\Gamma' \backslash G/K) \neq 0$ if and only if $\delta(G) = 0$.

*Proof.* By the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem, $\chi(\Gamma' \backslash G/K) = \int_{\Gamma' \backslash G/K} e(T(\Gamma' \backslash G/K))$ where $e$ is the Euler form.

If $\dim(G/K)$ is odd, then $\chi = 0$ by Poincaré duality, and $\delta(G) \neq 0$ (since equal rank forces even dimension).

If $\dim(G/K)$ is even, the dichotomy follows from the Hirzebruch proportionality principle (Hirzebruch, *Automorphe Formen und der Satz von Riemann-Roch*, 1958; Borel–Hirzebruch, *Characteristic classes and homogeneous spaces II*, Amer. J. Math. **81**, 1959, §§20–24):

- **$\delta(G) = 0$:** The compact dual $G_u/K$ has $\chi(G_u/K) = |W_G|/|W_K| \neq 0$ by the Hopf–Samelson theorem (since $K$ contains a maximal torus of $G_u$). By proportionality, $\chi(\Gamma' \backslash G/K) = c_G \cdot \operatorname{vol}(\Gamma' \backslash G/K) \neq 0$.

- **$\delta(G) \neq 0$:** The compact dual has $\chi(G_u/K) = 0$ (since $K$ does not contain a maximal torus of $G_u$). By proportionality, $\chi(\Gamma' \backslash G/K) = 0$.

This is also a consequence of Harder's Gauss–Bonnet theorem (Harder, *Ann. Sci. École Norm. Sup.* (4) **4**, 1971, 409–455). See also Serre, *Cohomologie des groupes discrets*, 1971, §3. $\square$

Combining Lemmas 1–3: since $\delta(G) = 0$, we have $\chi(M) = \chi_\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) = \chi(\Gamma' \backslash G/K)/m \neq 0$.

### Part B: $\chi(M) = 0$

We show all L²-Betti numbers of $\widetilde{M}$ vanish, forcing $\chi(M) = 0$ by Atiyah's L²-index theorem.

Since $M$ is compact, $\widetilde{M}$ admits a finite $\Gamma$-CW structure, so $C_*(\widetilde{M})$ consists of finitely generated free $\mathbb{Z}\Gamma$-modules. Set $C_*^\mathbb{Q} := C_*(\widetilde{M}) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Q}$, a chain complex of finitely generated free $\mathbb{Q}\Gamma$-modules with $H_i(C_*^\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for $i > 0$ and $H_0(C_*^\mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q}$.

The L²-Betti numbers are $b_i^{(2)}(\widetilde{M}; \Gamma) = \dim_{\mathcal{N}(\Gamma)} H_i(C_*^\mathbb{Q} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}\Gamma} \mathcal{N}(\Gamma))$.

By Lück's dimension-flatness theorem (Lück, *L²-Invariants*, Theorem 6.37), $\mathcal{N}(\Gamma)$ is dimension-flat over $\mathbb{Q}\Gamma$: exact sequences of $\mathbb{Q}\Gamma$-modules remain dimension-exact after tensoring with $\mathcal{N}(\Gamma)$. Since $C_*^\mathbb{Q}$ is exact in degrees $> 0$:
$$b_i^{(2)}(\widetilde{M}; \Gamma) = 0 \quad \text{for } i > 0.$$

For $i = 0$: $b_0^{(2)}(\widetilde{M}; \Gamma) = \dim_{\mathcal{N}(\Gamma)}(\mathbb{Q} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}\Gamma} \mathcal{N}(\Gamma)) = 0$ for any infinite group $\Gamma$. This is because the trivial representation $\mathbb{C}$ does not weakly embed in the regular representation $\ell^2(\Gamma)$: the matrix coefficient $\langle \delta_e, \gamma \cdot \delta_e \rangle = \delta_{\gamma,e} \to 0$ as $\gamma \to \infty$, so $\mathbb{Q} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}\Gamma} \mathcal{N}(\Gamma)$ has von Neumann dimension zero (Lück, *L²-Invariants*, Example 6.11).

Therefore $b_i^{(2)}(\widetilde{M}; \Gamma) = 0$ for all $i \geq 0$. By Atiyah's L²-index theorem (Lück, *L²-Invariants*, Theorem 1.35(2)):
$$\chi(M) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^i b_i^{(2)}(\widetilde{M}; \Gamma) = 0.$$

### Contradiction

Parts A and B give $0 = \chi(M) = \chi_\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) \neq 0$. $\square$

## Proof of the Main Theorem (Case $G \cong \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$, $\delta(G) = 1$, $d = 3$)

**Theorem.** Let $G = \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ (viewed as a real Lie group), so $K = \mathrm{SU}(2)$, $d = 3$, and $\delta(G) = 1$. Let $\Gamma \subset G$ be a uniform lattice with torsion. Then there is no closed manifold $M$ with $\pi_1(M) \cong \Gamma$ and $\widetilde{M}$ rationally acyclic.

*Proof.* Suppose for contradiction that such $M$ exists. By Corollary 2 (dimension forcing), $\dim M = d = 3$.

**Step 1: $\Gamma$ is not a nontrivial free product.** Since $\Gamma$ is a uniform lattice in $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$, it acts properly discontinuously and cocompactly on hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$. Since $\mathbb{H}^3$ is one-ended and the quotient is compact, $\Gamma$ has one end, so by Stallings' theorem $\Gamma$ does not split as a nontrivial free product.

**Step 2: $M$ is irreducible.** Since $M$ is a closed 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group $\Gamma$ that is not a nontrivial free product, the Kneser–Milnor prime decomposition forces $M$ to be prime. A prime 3-manifold is either $S^2 \times S^1$ (with $\pi_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}$, not our $\Gamma$) or irreducible.

**Step 3: Geometrization forces asphericity.** By Perelman's proof of Thurston's geometrization conjecture (Perelman, arXiv:math/0211159, arXiv:math/0303109, arXiv:math/0307245; see Morgan–Tian, *Ricci Flow and the Poincaré Conjecture*, Clay Math. Monographs **3**, 2007), every closed irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is aspherical: $\pi_i(M) = 0$ for $i \geq 2$, so $M \simeq B\Gamma$.

**Step 4: Asphericity contradicts torsion.** If $M$ is aspherical, then $\Gamma = \pi_1(M)$ is torsion-free: a finite-order element $g \in \Gamma$ generates a finite cyclic subgroup $\langle g \rangle$, and $B\langle g \rangle$ would be a retract of $B\Gamma = M$, but $B(\mathbb{Z}/n)$ has infinite cohomological dimension while $M$ is 3-dimensional — contradiction.

This contradicts the hypothesis that $\Gamma$ has torsion. $\square$

**Remark.** This argument uses Corollary 2 essentially: without dimension forcing, one could not invoke 3-manifold topology. The Euler characteristic obstruction does NOT apply here ($\delta(G) = 1$, so $\chi_\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) = 0$). The only semi-simple group with $d = 3$ is $G = \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ (up to local isomorphism).

---

## Classification: No $d = 4$ Case Exists

**Proposition.** No connected real semi-simple $G$ (finite center, no compact factors) has $\delta(G) \neq 0$ and $\dim(G/K) = 4$. All simple groups with $d = 4$ — namely $\mathrm{SU}(2,1)$, $\mathrm{SO}_0(4,1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2,\mathbb{R})$ — have $\delta = 0$. Products with $d_1 + d_2 = 4$ and $\delta \neq 0$ would require a factor with $d = 1$ (impossible) or factors with $d = 2$ (only $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, $\delta = 0$). The first open case is $d = 5$: $G = \mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{R})$.

---

## Analysis of the Case $\delta(G) \neq 0$, $d \geq 5$

When $\delta(G) \neq 0$ and $d = \dim(G/K) \geq 5$ (the smallest case being $G = \mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{R})$, $d = 5$), both the Euler characteristic obstruction and the geometrization obstruction are unavailable. We investigate whether other obstructions exist. **This section is analysis, not proof; we do not resolve the question for this case.**

### Surgery-theoretic landscape

By the Farrell–Jones conjecture, proved for cocompact lattices by Bartels–Farrell–Lück (*JAMS* **27**, 2014, 339–388), the assembly map $H_n^\Gamma(\underline{E}\Gamma; \mathbf{L}_\mathbb{Z}) \xrightarrow{\cong} L_n(\mathbb{Z}\Gamma)$ is an isomorphism. The 2-torsion elements contribute through $L_n(\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}/2])$, which is nontrivial (containing Arf invariant obstructions in odd dimensions).

### Sullivan splitting observation

Sullivan's splitting at the prime 2 gives $G/\mathrm{Top}_{(2)} \simeq \prod_{i \geq 1} K(\mathbb{Z}_{(2)}, 4i) \times \prod_{i \geq 0} K(\mathbb{Z}/2, 4i+2)$. The normal invariant decomposes into:
- **Rational components** in $H^{4i}(Y; \mathbb{Z}_{(2)})$: constrained by $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclicity (via rational Pontrjagin classes).
- **Mod-2 components** in $H^{4i+2}(Y; \mathbb{Z}/2)$: **unconstrained** by $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclicity.

Since the Arf invariant obstruction comes from the mod-2 components, it can in principle be avoided by adjusting the mod-2 normal invariant independently of the rational data. This means the surgery obstruction from 2-torsion is not a genuine obstruction — provided a suitable Poincaré complex exists to begin with.

### Other obstructions investigated

- **Smith theory:** The 2-torsion elements act freely on $\widetilde{M}$ (since $\Gamma$ acts freely), so Smith theory for free $\mathbb{Z}/2$-actions gives no constraint from $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclicity alone.
- **Finiteness:** $\mathrm{cd}_\mathbb{Q}(\Gamma) = d < \infty$, so no finiteness obstruction arises.
- **Integral Poincaré duality:** The transfer from the torsion-free subgroup gives rational Poincaré duality for $\Gamma$, consistent with the requirements.
- **L²-torsion:** When all L²-Betti numbers vanish, the L²-torsion $\rho^{(2)}(\widetilde{M}; \Gamma)$ is defined. For locally symmetric spaces with $\delta(G) = 1$, $\rho^{(2)} \neq 0$ (Olbrich; Lück–Schick). However, L²-torsion is computed from Fuglede-Kadison determinants of the boundary maps over $\mathbb{Z}\Gamma$ (Lück, Theorem 3.93), which depend on the full integral chain complex — not just rational homology. Q-acyclicity does not constrain these determinants. Moreover, $\rho^{(2)}(\widetilde{M}; \Gamma)$ and $\rho^{(2)}(G/K; \Gamma')$ are invariants of *different spaces*, so no direct comparison is available.

### The remaining gap

The question reduces to: *does there exist a finite integral Poincaré complex $Y$ with $\pi_1(Y) = \Gamma$ and $\widetilde{Y}$ $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic?* The orbifold $\Gamma \backslash G/K$ is a rational Poincaré complex with the right properties, but promoting it to an integral Poincaré complex requires controlling the torsion in the homology of the singular locus. This is a delicate question about the interaction between the torsion in $\Gamma$ and the integral topology of the classifying space for proper actions.

If such $Y$ exists, the Sullivan splitting analysis shows the surgery obstruction can be killed, and a manifold $M$ with the required properties exists (answer: YES for that $\Gamma$). If no such $Y$ exists for any $\Gamma$ with 2-torsion in any $G$ with $\delta(G) \neq 0$, the answer is NO — but for Poincaré complex reasons, not surgery.

---

## Why 2-torsion is mentioned

In the $\delta(G) = 0$ case, the obstruction applies to *any* lattice with *any* torsion — the 2-torsion hypothesis is not needed. The fact that 2-torsion is singled out in the problem statement suggests the intended focus is the $\delta(G) \neq 0$ case, where 2-torsion affects the L-groups $L_n(\mathbb{Z}\Gamma)$ through $L_n(\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}/2])$ and the Sullivan splitting at the prime 2 becomes relevant.

**Answer definitively NO (all $d \leq 4$):** $G = \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$, $\mathrm{SU}(n,1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(n,1)$, $\mathrm{SO}(2n,1)$ (all $\delta = 0$); $\mathrm{SU}(2,1)$, $\mathrm{SO}_0(4,1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2,\mathbb{R})$ ($d = 4$, $\delta = 0$); $G = \mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ ($\delta = 1$, $d = 3$, geometrization).

**Status open** ($\delta \neq 0$, $d \geq 5$): $G = \mathrm{SL}(3, \mathbb{R})$ ($d = 5$, **smallest open case**), $\mathrm{SL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ for $n \geq 3$ ($d \geq 5$), $\mathrm{SO}(p,q)$ with $p \neq q$ and $d \geq 5$.
