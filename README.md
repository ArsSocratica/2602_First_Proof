# First Proof Challenge — AI Solutions & Lean Formalizations

**A non-mathematician's experiment with frontier AI on genuine research-level mathematics.**

*By Mark Dillerop*

This repository contains my responses to the 10 problems from the [**First Proof**](https://1stproof.org/) benchmark (released February 2026), as featured in the New York Times article ["These Mathematicians Are Putting A.I. to the Test"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/07/science/mathematics-ai-proof-hairer.html).

**Challenge paper:** [arXiv:2602.05192](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05192)

## Background

I am **not a mathematician**. I have no formal mathematical training beyond high school. Using only prompting, review, and iteration with AI systems (Claude Opus 4.6, Grok, Gemini 3, ChatGPT 5.2 Pro, and Perplexity), I produced:

- Full solution papers for all 10 problems
- Lean 4 formalizations of the algebraic and logical skeletons


## Results

**9 out of 10** main theorems were **fully proved from axioms** with zero `sorry`.
Only **P04** remains partial (the general case for n ≥ 4 is mathematically open — no proof exists anywhere, by any method).

| P01 | Φ⁴₃ measure equivalence | Stochastic PDE | **NO** — mutually singular | 11 | [PDF](04_papers/P01_paper.pdf) |

| P07 | Lattice acyclicity | Lie groups | **NO** for δ=0 or d≤4 | 12 | [PDF](04_papers/P07_paper.pdf) |
| P08 | Lagrangian smoothing | Symplectic geometry | **YES** — smoothing exists | 6 | [PDF](04_papers/P08_paper.pdf) |
| P09 | Quadrilinear tensors | Multilinear algebra | **YES** — degree ≤ 4 | 9 | [PDF](04_papers/P09_paper.pdf) |

## Lean 4 Formalization

1,932 lines of Lean 4 across 10 files, verified with Mathlib v4.27.0.

- **119 custom axioms** modeling objects not yet in Mathlib
- **1 sorry** (P04 n≥4 — mathematically open, not a formalization gap)
- **9/10 main theorems fully proved** from axioms

See the [Lean formalization paper](05_lean_formalization/lean_formalization.pdf) for details.

## Methodology

All mathematical content, proofs, and Lean code were generated by AI:
**Claude Opus 4.6** (Anthropic), **Gemini 3** (Google), **ChatGPT 5.2 Pro** (OpenAI), **Perplexity**, and **Grok** (xAI).

My role was orchestration and cross-checking between models. No axioms, no mathematical ideas, and no Lean code came from me.

AI interaction transcripts in `02_proofs/*/transcript.md` are **summaries**, not verbatim logs.

## Purpose

This project serves as an independent, external test of the First Proof benchmark using current frontier AI. The outcomes are interesting either way: if the solutions align with the official answers, it validates frontier AI's potential for research-level mathematics. If not, it demonstrates how convincingly these systems generate plausible, coherent mathematical content — underscoring the importance of formal verification and expert scrutiny.
