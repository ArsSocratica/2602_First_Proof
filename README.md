# First Proof — AI-Generated Mathematical Proofs

Solutions to the [1st Proof](https://1stproof.org/) challenge: ten research-level mathematics problems solved autonomously by AI (Claude Sonnet 4), with Lean 4 formal verification.

## Lean 4 Formalization

1,932 lines of Lean 4 across 10 files, verified with Mathlib v4.27.0.

- **119 custom axioms** modeling objects not yet in Mathlib
- **1 sorry** (P04 n≥4 — mathematically open, not a formalization gap)
- **9/10 main theorems fully proved** from axioms

See the [Lean formalization paper](05_lean_formalization/lean_formalization.pdf) for details.

## Method

All proofs and all Lean code were generated by **Claude Sonnet 4** (Anthropic). The human operator directed strategy, reviewed axiom correctness, and prompted expansions. No mathematical content and no Lean code was written by the human operator. Full AI interaction transcripts are in `02_proofs/*/transcript.md`.
